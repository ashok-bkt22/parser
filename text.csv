" Despite encouragement from regulators, financial institutions experience mixed results ranging from prompt responses to requests, at best, to requests that are never addressed, at worst. ","“Despite encouragement from regulators, financial institutions experience mixed results ranging from, at best, prompt responses to requests to, at worst, requests that are never addressed.”","Here, though the sentence’s parallel structure is sound, clarity is improved if the parenthetical phrases “at best” and “at worst” precede rather than follow the pertinent wording so that the reader knows before the fact, not belatedly, that a scaled comparison of results, not just random examples of them, are being introduced"
" Once executive management and the board agree on the drivers of, and strategic, operational, and financial parameters around, opportunity-seeking behavior, the resulting risk-appetite statement is a reminder of the core risk strategy arising from the strategy-setting process.","“Once executive management and the board agree on the drivers of opportunity-seeking behavior and the strategic, operational, and financial parameters around it, the resulting risk-appetite statement is a reminder of the core risk strategy arising from the strategy-setting process.”","This sentence is technically correct, but the complexity of the parenthetical phrase “and the strategic, operational, and financial parameters around,” and the distance it places between the parallel phrase “drivers of” and the phrase “the resulting risk-appetite statement,” which applies to both parallel phrases, renders the sentence difficult to digest. A better solution is to relocate the second parallel phrase to follow the key phrase, introducing a more complete portion of the main clause before the interruption and reducing the number of commas"
" Even though the program contains all the same components, the level of rigor and detail, and the amount of automation through workflow, changes with the size and risk profile of the company.","“Even though the program contains all the same components, the level of rigor and detail—and the amount of automation through workflow—changes with the size and risk profile of the company.”","Readers may get the impression that the phrases “the same components,” “the level and rigor and detail,” and “the amount of automation through workflow” are parallel elements of a list. But “the same components” is part of an introductory subordinate clause, and the second and third phrases constitute a complex subject of the sentence. To make the sentence clearer by breaking up the false list, recast the final phrase as a parenthetical"
" Professor Smith’s comments are utterly reprehensible, deeply disturbing, and do not in any way reflect the values of the university.",“Professor Smith’s comments are utterly reprehensible and deeply disturbing and do not in any way reflect the values of the university.”,"Because the phrase beginning with  has its own verb, it is not part of a list beginning with “utterly reprehensible” and continuing with “deeply disturbing,” so those two phrases should be linked with a conjunction, and the commas that follow them must be omitted"
" Thousands of the organization’s workers face resistance, fear—and terrorists—as they try to eradicate the crippling disease.",“Thousands of the organization’s workers face resistance and fear—and terrorists—as they try to eradicate the crippling disease.”,"Similarly, the parenthetical phrase “and terrorists” is not part of a list that also includes ; those two terms constitute the list, and “and terrorists” is distinct, so the treatment of the list must be revised"
" Traditional financial institutions have significantly enhanced their risk and compliance programs by increasing resources, clarifying roles and responsibilities across the three lines of defense, upgrading their governance frameworks, as well as maintaining higher levels of capital.","“Traditional financial institutions have significantly enhanced their risk and compliance programs by increasing resources, clarifying roles and responsibilities across the three lines of defense, and upgrading their governance frameworks, as well as maintaining higher levels of capital.” ",“Maintaining higher levels of capital” is not part of the list in this sentence—“as well as” marks the phrase consisting of those eight words as a distinct appendage tacked onto the main clause—so the final item in the list must be preceded by a conjunction
" What you hear symbolizes something ominous—impending danger lurking just beneath the surface, which has been hanging over our heads in recent years.","“What you hear symbolizes something ominous—impending danger lurking just beneath the surface, which has percolating in recent years.” ( is also a metaphor, but such one-word analogies embedded in our language do not distract as easily as more vivid imagery, and the verb is concordant with the preceding metaphor.)","The metaphors in this sentence come at the reader from both directions, with an allusion to subterranean peril and an indirect reference to the anecdote of the sword of Damocles, in which a king suspends a sword over a courtier’s head by a single hair to teach the man a lesson about the peril of being in a position of power. To avoid this discordance, the metaphors should be consistent in imagery"
 These actions resulted in a significant redirection of market focus and gave the firms a ringside seat when the proverbial music stopped.,“These actions resulted in a significant redirection of market focus and gave the firms a ringside seat when that shift occurred.”,"“A ringside seat” refers to achieving a privileged position (literally, a front-row seat at a boxing match), and the phrase about music alludes to surviving a round of the game of musical chairs, in which competitors circle a group of chairs that numbers one less than the number of participants and vie to obtain a seat when music that is briefly played suddenly ceases, causing one person to be disqualified in each round. Although both metaphors deal, in a sense, with attainment of privilege, the contexts are different, and one is best abandoned in favor of the other"
 The same division within the party that derailed healthcare reform could also rear its head with respect to tax reform. ,“The same division within the party that derailed healthcare reform could also occur with respect to tax reform.” (An attempt to match the derailment reference with another train-related metaphor will only call attention to the symmetry at the expense of the point of the sentence.),"The reference to figurative derailment is at odds with the clichéd metaphor of a threatening creature preparing to strike. Again, sacrifice one metaphor for another (preferably, replacing the cliché with a straightforward verb)"
" These projects provide the needed insight as to where these measures work, don’t work, and why.","“These projects provide the needed insight as to where these measures work, where they don’t work, and why they don’t work.” However, a simpler, more concise solution is to combine  and “don’t work” into one element: “These projects provide the needed insight as to where these measures work or don’t work and why.”",One solution for this sentence is to express the elements completely
" Many lament a system that is unfair, discriminatory, and one where the American Dream is out of reach.","“Many lament a system that is unfair and discriminatory, and one where the American Dream is out of reach.” (Those words may seem redundant, but in context they are distinct.)","Sentences such as this, as with the first revision in the previous example, can often be repaired by supporting the middle element of the list with phrasing parallel to that of the first and last elements, but the final element is problematic, too, so the simplest approach is to pair "
" The convergence of increased regulation, the need for modernization and innovation, combined with an exponential increase in cyber risk, creates a major challenge for insurance companies. ","“The convergence of increased regulation and the need for modernization and innovation, combined with an exponential increase in cyber risk, creates a major challenge for insurance companies.”","The complication in this sentence is that “combined with an exponential increase in cyber risk” is treated as a list item rather than a related but distinct parenthetical. In addition, the second item, with its “” structure, is already complex. But the simple first item and the complex second item can easily be bridged with a conjunction rather than a comma to become syntactically valid"
" A number of factors are at play for the industry, including the UK’s Brexit vote that continues to have an impact on financial markets. ","“A number of factors are at play for the industry, including the UK’s Brexit vote, which continues to have an impact on financial markets.” ","Here, the implication is that two or more Brexit votes occurred, though only one continues to have an impact on financial markets. But “continues to have an impact on financial markets” is merely an explanatory phrase describing a consequence of the Brexit vote, only one of which occurred, so the explanation should be framed in a subordinate clause set off by a comma and beginning with "
" The company is a growing business-to-business payments provider, which has been established by a collaboration of banks.","“The company is a growing B2B payments provider that has been established by a collaboration of banks.” (However, the statement can be made more succinctly: “The company is a growing business-to-business payments provider established by a collaboration of banks.”)","Because the company is only one of many such businesses, the phrase describing by whom it was established is essential to the statement, so that phrase should not be set off as a subordinate clause"
" Offshore finance changed forever in April 2016 with the leak of 11.5 million documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panama-based law firm which specializes in the formation and management of entities in tax havens.","“Offshore finance changed forever in April 2016 with the leak of 11.5 million documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panama-based law firm that specializes in the formation and management of entities in tax havens.” ","Here, again, the description is essential to the sentence, so it is correctly treated as integral to the sentence and not set off by a comma. However, for additional clarity, that should replace "
" Another factor is the actual speed of disruption; specifically, the ability of organizations to change rapidly.","“Another factor is the actual speed of disruption—specifically, the ability of organizations to change rapidly.” (Parenthesizing the subordinate clause is also an option, but parentheses serve to diminish the impact of additional information, while a dash emphasizes it.)","A semicolon used as a weak period must separate two independent clauses. Because the second half of this sentence is a mere subordinate clause, the semicolon is not appropriate. Using a comma in place of a semicolon fails to clarify the hierarchy of the sentence (preceding and following  with a comma would at least temporarily obscure whether specifically applies to the clause before it or the one that follows), so a dash is the best alternative"
 This evaluation should include ascertaining which account balances are touched by the work of the provider; the related internal control assertions; how results are evaluated for reasonableness within established tolerances as dictated by the desired precision of the control activities in question; and whether the provider conforms to the organization’s code of conduct.,"“This evaluation should include ascertaining which account balances are touched by the work of the provider, the related internal control assertions, how results are evaluated for reasonableness within established tolerances as dictated by the desired precision of the control activities in question, and whether the provider conforms to the organization’s code of conduct.”","Most of the list items in this sentence are long, but a semicolon exists to delineate complex phrases that already include commas rather than to set off extensive phrases; the statement is coherent without fortifying the divisions by changing the punctuation from commas to semicolons, so the latter are not necessary"
" Soon, it becomes clear that the implications of the change reach farther than the finance and accounting group to impact operations, potentially leading to decisions to restructure customer contracts and pricing models; adjust sales commission and incentive compensation plans; modify debt covenants; assess tax planning strategies; and impact mergers and acquisitions transactions, forecasting reports, executive dashboards, and partnership and joint venture reports.","“Soon, it becomes clear that the implications of the change reach farther than the finance and accounting group to impact operations, potentially leading to decisions to restructure customer contracts and pricing models, adjust sales commission and incentive compensation plans, modify debt covenants, assess tax planning strategies, and impact mergers and acquisitions transactions, forecasting reports, executive dashboards, and partnership and joint venture reports.”","Readers might conceivably be confused by this sentence’s organization because of the complexity of the list item “impact mergers . . . joint venture reports,” so retaining the semicolons is defensible, but because it is last in the sentence, it is probably safe to simplify punctuation by using commas in place of semicolons"
 More than half of all companies are currently pursuing some form of major information-technology transformation.,“More than half of all companies are pursuing some form of major information-technology transformation.”,", which echoes the present-tense verbs it invariably is associated with, is rarely necessary or helpful; retain it only if it clarifies an ambiguous statement (in which case an alternative solution is to revise the statement to eliminate the ambiguity)"
" Management must then determine whether or not the activities for recording, accumulating, and summarizing material information are designed and operating effectively.","“Management must then determine whether the activities for recording, accumulating, and summarizing material information are designed and operating effectively.”","Some writers don’t realize that the second and third word in “whether or not” should almost always be omitted. Others know this but automatically write it without noticing or don’t know when it is valid and when it is not. However, a simple test exists—if “whether or not” can be replaced by “regardless of whether,” the usage is valid, but if the phrase can be replaced by , “or not” is extraneous"
 We have managed projects for both healthcare providers as well as medical-device manufacturers.,“We have managed projects for both healthcare providers and medical-device manufacturers” or “We have managed projects for healthcare providers as well as medical-device manufacturers.”,"Sometimes the solution is revision rather than omission.

" Much of what happened between the moment Jones sat on a bench to enjoy the view and police opened fire and killed him, has been the subject of contentious debate. ","“Much of what happened between the moment Jones sat on a bench to enjoy the view and police opened fire and killed him has been the subject of contentious debate.” (An example of the type of exception noted is “Much of what happened between the moment Jones sat on a bench to enjoy the view and police opened fire and kill him, and why the police reacted the way they did, has been the subject of contentious debate.”)",A verb is preceded by a comma only when that comma is one of a pair that frames a parenthetical phrase
" The stakes are high because, without effective management of regulatory risks, organizations are reactive, at best, and noncompliant, at worst, with all of the attendant consequences.","“The stakes are high because, without effective management of regulatory risks, organizations are reactive at best and noncompliant at worst, with all of the attendant consequences.” (Note that in the case of “at worst,” only the preceding comma can be deleted, because the one that follows it serves double duty, setting off the subordinate clause as well.)","The punctuation bracketing the phrases “at best” and “at worst” is optional, but because they, in combination with the required commas that set off the sentence’s parenthetical phrase and its subordinate clause, create a cluttered effect, it’s best to omit the discretionary ones"
" He would replace conservative, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last month, leaving behind a bitter election-year fight over the future of the court.","“He would replace conservative justice Antonin Scalia, who died last month, leaving behind a bitter election-year fight over the future of the court.” (Note that because the descriptor is “conservative justice,” not simply , justice is not a job title and is therefore not capitalized.)","This sentence is punctuated as if “Justice Antonin Scalia” is an appositive of  is simply part of a descriptor providing additional information about the person named; therefore, no intervening punctuation is necessary"
" They can lean toward easier-to-maintain, off-the-shelf server, network, and storage gear.","“They can lean toward off-the-shelf server, network, and storage gear that is easier to maintain.”","Hyphenation of the phrasal adjectives “easier to maintain” and “off the shelf,” both of which modify the phrase “server, network, and storage gear” is correct, but the double dose of multiple hyphenation, complicated by the fact that the phrases modify a phrase rather than a single word, clutters the sentence. Relaxing the statement as shown here improves readability"
 The company’s conversation about buying a brand can evolve into a mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A)-type dialogue.,"“The company’s conversation about buying a brand can evolve into a dialogue similar to that regarding mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A).” (Also, technically, temporarily disregarding the parenthesis, an en dash should replace the hyphen in the original sentence to signal that  but to the entire phrase “mergers and acquisitions”: “The company’s conversation about buying a brand can evolve into a mergers and acquisitions–type dialogue.”)","Identifying a term’s abbreviation within parentheses immediately after the first reference to the term when the abbreviation will be used in place of the term in subsequent references is standard procedure, but when the term is modified by a word attached to it with a hyphen, the intervening parenthesis is intrusive. Again, sentence relaxation is a simple solution"
 The next step should be to evaluate the effectiveness of existing practices in customer information collection strategies.,“The next step should be to evaluate the effectiveness of existing practices in strategies for collecting customer information.”,"Technically, the string of nouns turned adjectives that combine to modify  should be hyphenated to signal their teamwork (“The next step should be to evaluate the effectiveness of existing practices in customer-information-collection strategies”), but that three-car train of adjectives can be avoided by relaxing the sentence"
 Executive management should ensure that their companies are focused on the attributes that make for early-mover status and implement an early-warning capability. ,Ensure something and implement something. But it reads as if the company should do two things: focus on something and implement something.

" Healthcare providers are expected to not only keep up with these changes, but also to look ahead.",“Healthcare providers are expected to not only keep up with these changes but also look ahead.” (If  would be necessary after the complementary phrase “but also.”),"In this sentence, because the first  precedes “not only,” it serves for “but also” as well"

" They wanted to evolve the organization beyond its roots as a traditional hospital network with success measured by occupancy, or “heads in beds.”","“They wanted to evolve the organization beyond its roots as a traditional hospital network with success measured by ‘heads in beds,’ or occupancy.”","When an informal word or phrase used as a synonym for a more formal term appears, the coinage often follows the standard term as an appositive (a term equivalent to an adjacent term), which is illogical—why introduce the slang term after using the official one, when, whether it appears again or not, it seems immediately redundant? The only sensible reason to use both synonyms is to first introduce an informal term that will subsequently reappear in the piece of content, then gloss (briefly define) it with the formal term; thereafter, when readers encounter the term again, they will have already been informed of its meaning"
 The issue has been under the spotlight in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Monetary Authority spokesperson John Chang commented on its response last week.,"“The issue has been under the spotlight in Hong Kong. John Chang, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, commented on its response last week.”","In this sentence, “Hong Kong” is awkwardly repeated in immediate succession, separated only by a period, which makes it difficult to read. The phrase describing John Chang’s affiliation is easily relocated to follow his name, a solution recommended in general when such a description is extensive"
 The customer risk rating calculation methodology should be adjusted to take into account any heightened risk of financial crime.,“The methodology for calculating customer-risk rating should be adjusted to take into account any heightened risk of financial crime.”,"The adjectival cluster that precedes  is awkward because all the words in that string are nouns serving as adjectives, and the reader can easily become frustrated about having to haltingly read the phrase while trying to parse where the phrasal adjective ends. The technically correct solution is to hyphenate the string, but the result is unwieldy. Better yet, relax the sentence to reduce the number of elements in the phrasal adjective"

" The disclosure of data, even, or especially, to law enforcement, is a hot topic. ","“The disclosure of data—even, or especially, to law enforcement—is a hot topic.” ","In this case, the reader will likely have to backtrack to diagram this sentence in his or her mind to process that “data, even, or especially” is not a list and that  is the beginning of a two-layer parenthesis; frame the outer parenthesis with dashes to distinguish it from the inner parenthesis"
" When you write for a newspaper, you actually can change the world, well at least a corner of it, for some people.","“When you write for a newspaper, you actually can change the world—well, at least a corner of it—for some people.”","The problem here is similar to that of the previous example, in that  must be set off from the rest of the parenthesis of which it is a part. To distinguish between the punctuation used to do so and the punctuation employed to emphasize the parenthesis itself, promote the quotidian commas to distinctive dashes"
" Ultimately, it isn’t the strongest or the smartest companies that survive and prosper, but those that successfully adapt to change.","“Ultimately, it isn’t the strongest or the smartest companies, but those that successfully adapt to change, that survive and prosper.”","Because “survive and prosper” applies to both the point and the counterpoint, it is best located at the end of the sentence; otherwise, the phrases ending in “that survive and prosper” and “that successfully adapt to change” appear to be distinct, whereas the second phrase, as part of the larger phrase beginning with , is subordinate to the main clause"

 These results are not surprising because cyber risks have evolved into a moving target.,"“These results are not surprising, because cyber risks have evolved into a moving target.”","This sentence, as written, suggests that the reader, after learning from the second half of the sentence what is not the reason the results are surprising, will read in a subsequent sentence the reason they are. But “cyber risks have evolved into a moving target” is the reason the results are not surprising, which is made clear simply by applying a brief pause to the sentence in the form of a comma preceding the explanation, which renders the explanation a subordinate clause set off from the premise of the sentence (“The results are not surprising”)"
" By taking a risk-based approach, such changes can be tailored to fit the company’s specific risk posture.","“By taking a risk-based approach, one can tailor such changes to fit the company’s specific risk posture.”","All too often, writers mistakenly craft sentences in which subordinate clauses placed as introductory phrases are assumed to pertain to the subject of the main clauses when the two elements are only tangentially related.
